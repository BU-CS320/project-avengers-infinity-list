# Project

Follow the [instructions](INSTRUCTIONS.md), use this space to document your project for yourself and the graders.

## Continuous Integration
Travis-CI: https://travis-ci.com/BU-CS320/project-avengers-infinity-list/
If you click the link above and log in to your GitHub account that has admin priviliges on the BU-CS320 repo, you will be redirected to the corresponding Travis-CI instance for this project. The three separate builds are each for commonly used versions of Haskell and in terms of a best practice, this would ensure safety across machines if this were made available to the public.

## Summary
This is the programming language with which we will defeat ThanOS. Through our masterful use of recursion, we will create a stack overflow so large that ThanOS itself will split, shattering the Infinity Monad into its six components: Maybe, Reader, Writer, IO, State, and Parser. With the power of these Monadic Gems, we will conquer the universe and divide the number of sane CS majors by half.

In reality, we have implemented all vanilla features and five of the low-value mix-ins.
