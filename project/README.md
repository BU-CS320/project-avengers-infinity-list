## Summary
This is the programming language with which we will defeat ThanOS. Through our masterful use of recursion, we will create a stack overflow so large that ThanOS itself will split, shattering the Infinity Monad into its six components: Maybe, Reader, Writer, IO, State, and Parser. With the power of these Monadic Gems, we will conquer the universe and divide the number of sane CS majors by half.

In reality, we have implemented all vanilla features and five of the low-value mix-ins.
