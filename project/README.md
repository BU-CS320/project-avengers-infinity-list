## Summary

## Plan
Vanilla Features
Next meeting, we will compare efficiencies between our codes and choose the most efficient versions for the functions we already have from the homeworks. The following functions, which we do not have, will be evenly divided up in the following manner.

David Kirk
Equals
Not-equal
Less-than
Less-than-or-equal

Jason Hong
Greater-than-or-equal
Greater-than
Floating-Point Division
Floating-Point Exponentiation

James Mortenson
Integer Exponential
List indexing operator
Unary minus
(some) atomic expressions

Mix-In Features
We will be implementing ALL of the "simple" additions, as well as TWO of the engineering best practices, and the Parser error reporting features.

David Kirk
Infix operator (.)
Quickcheck generator and shrinker for AST

Jason Hong
Multi-support lambda
Haddock style comments and html documentation

James Mortenson
Sequential let
Adding letrec

Together: Error reporting Parser monad errors, w/ clear error messages
