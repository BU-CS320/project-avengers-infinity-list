## Summary
This is the programming language with which we will defeat ThanOS. Through our masterful use of recursion, we will create a stack overflow so large that ThanOS itself will split, shattering the Infinity Monad into its six components: Maybe, Reader, Writer, IO, State, and Parser. With the power of these Monadic Gems, we will conquer the universe and divide the number of sane CS majors by half.

But actually, we're planning to add the following features to the bare minimum plan:
- all "simple" additions (4*5pts = 20pts)
- 2/3 best practices (2*5pts = 10pts)
- error reporting for parser monad (10pts)

## Plan
Vanilla Features
Next meeting, we will compare efficiencies between our codes and choose the most efficient versions for the functions we already have from the homeworks. The following functions, which we do not have, will be evenly divided up in the following manner.

David Kirk
- Equals
- Not-equal
- Less-than
- Less-than-or-equal

Jason Hong
- Greater-than-or-equal
- Greater-than
- Floating-Point Division
- Floating-Point Exponentiation

James Mortenson
- Integer Exponential
- List indexing operator
- Unary minus
- (some) atomic expressions

Mix-In Features
We will be implementing ALL of the "simple" additions, as well as TWO of the engineering best practices, and the Parser error reporting features.

David Kirk
- Infix operator (.)
- Quickcheck generator and shrinker for AST

Jason Hong
- Multi-support lambda
- Haddock style comments and html documentation

James Mortenson
- Sequential let
- Adding letrec

- Together: Error reporting Parser monad errors, w/ clear error messages
